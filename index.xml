Strangely enough I did not keep notes on what I did to get it to work and when I did a fresh installation on Fedora 34, the old error haunted me back again.
Leaning from the past mistake, I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s time to start taking notes on what&amp;rsquo;s the error encountered and what did I do to fix it.</description></item><item><title>Moving back to hallajs.net</title><link>http://ghpages-stage.hallajs.net/posts/2021-02-03-migrated-back-to-hallajs-net/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://ghpages-stage.hallajs.net/posts/2021-02-03-migrated-back-to-hallajs-net/</guid><description>Migrated this back from inu.io to hallajs.net for now and keeping it hosted under GitHub Pages.
I suppose I&amp;rsquo;m trying to split the functionalities of both environments again, oh well.
At least had the chance to use GitHub Actions to deploy this static page with Hugo, so that&amp;rsquo;s that.</description></item><item><title>Fedora Kickstart for Openbox</title><link>http://ghpages-stage.hallajs.net/posts/2020-08-07-fedora-kickstart-for-openbox/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://ghpages-stage.hallajs.net/posts/2020-08-07-fedora-kickstart-for-openbox/</guid><description>For a while now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been installing Fedora either through the netinstall method, or using the server&amp;rsquo;s ISO to install just the base OS before setting up Openbox during the first boot.
However, after the recent OS reinstallation that I had, I wondered if it&amp;rsquo;s actually possible to have an ISO ready for me, with just the change I need and after reading around, I found Kickstart and that&amp;rsquo;s helped me to archieve this goal.</description></item><item><title>pptpd on Fedora 23 Cloud Edition on DigitalOcean</title><link>http://ghpages-stage.hallajs.net/posts/2016-03-30-pptpd-on-fedora-23-cloud-edition-on-digitalocean/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://ghpages-stage.hallajs.net/posts/2016-03-30-pptpd-on-fedora-23-cloud-edition-on-digitalocean/</guid><description>Well, I finally did it. I was bored and decided to setup PPTPD on my DigitalOcean&amp;rsquo;s VM and let my OpenWRT router connect to it. This allows me to tunnel using DigitalOcean and enjoy a slightly better international bandwidth via it.
The current downfall that I see is that I had to drop my MTU to 1000 in order to get my speed optimized. I&amp;rsquo;ll still be fiddling around with it to see what works best, but below are the steps done in order to archive it.</description></item><item><title>Migrated content from hallajs.net</title><link>http://ghpages-stage.hallajs.net/posts/2015-12-19-migrated-content-from-hallajs-net/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://ghpages-stage.hallajs.net/posts/2015-12-19-migrated-content-from-hallajs-net/</guid><description>I have &amp;ldquo;again&amp;rdquo; allowed my hallajs.net domain to expire and I&amp;rsquo;ll only be maintaining inu.io as of now.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also migrated the content of hallajs.net here (although, I have to admit, it took a very long time).
This site is now running on Middleman instead of Ghost :)</description></item><item><title>PPTP Client on OpenWRT</title><link>http://ghpages-stage.hallajs.net/posts/2015-06-21-pptp-client-on-openwrt/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://ghpages-stage.hallajs.net/posts/2015-06-21-pptp-client-on-openwrt/</guid><description>PPTP Client on OpenWRT Refresh the OpenWRT&amp;rsquo;s repository

Clone your existing OpenShift repository:
git clone &amp;lt;openshift_repository&amp;gt; &amp;lt;path&amp;gt; Change directory to the checkout path:
cd &amp;lt;path&amp;gt; Add the Ghost OpenShift quickstart repository:
git remote add ghost_openshift https://github.com/openshift-quickstart/openshift-ghost-quickstart.git Pull the latest changes from it:</description></item><item><title>Yet another Greenplum Interconnect error</title><link>http://ghpages-stage.hallajs.net/posts/2014-06-26-yet-another-greenplum-interconnect-error/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://ghpages-stage.hallajs.net/posts/2014-06-26-yet-another-greenplum-interconnect-error/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve faced yet another Greenplum Interconnect error with the following error:

(seg0 slice1 gpslave1:40000 pid=14231)&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Connection refused (connect errno 111)&amp;#34; After doing tons of checks on the gpslave1 server itself, nothing was found to be problematic. Ping shows reply, telnet to the ports shows active and no errors could be found.
Finally, on the master itself, I tried to ping the configured host of the master and it returned 127.</description></item><item><title>Nicer font in Fedora 20</title><link>http://ghpages-stage.hallajs.net/posts/2014-03-22-nicer-font-in-fedora-20/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://ghpages-stage.hallajs.net/posts/2014-03-22-nicer-font-in-fedora-20/</guid><description>Okay, to start this off - I&amp;rsquo;m actually a Crunchbang user. Recently my laptop&amp;rsquo;s hard disk died and while waiting for a replacement, I decided to revive an older laptop of mine and give Fedora a try.
I would say that everything was perfect, well - &amp;ldquo;almost&amp;rdquo; but I simply hated the font! That prompted me to go on a journey to get the font fixed.
Browsing around and I start to notice that I was not the only one with issues.</description></item><item><title>Brain freeze</title><link>http://ghpages-stage.hallajs.net/posts/2014-02-24-brain-freeze/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://ghpages-stage.hallajs.net/posts/2014-02-24-brain-freeze/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been having somewhat of a brain freeze lately.
