Recently my laptop&amp;rsquo;s hard disk died and while waiting for a replacement, I decided to revive an older laptop of mine and give Fedora a try.
I would say that everything was perfect, well - &amp;ldquo;almost&amp;rdquo; but I simply hated the font! That prompted me to go on a journey to get the font fixed.
Browsing around and I start to notice that I was not the only one with issues.</description></item></channel></rss>
